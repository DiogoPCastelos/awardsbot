## Description

Discord Bot I made to help a livestream with prize giving. This way I ensured the streamer didn't know who won until it was time to reveal the winner. Making the reactions more organic! Also made it so that there was a permanent card with the name of the winner on the guild we were in. Making it like a reward in itself.
