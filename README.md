the only discord bot I don't mind open sourcing haha (pretty much just the same as a card with the winner of an award, but for events on discord. This way the announcer doesn't know who won until they do the command)

you need a .env file on root btw with:

TOKEN=___ \n
MONGO_URL=___ \n
GUILD_ID=___

(discord bot token, mongo url, and guild id that you wanna add)
